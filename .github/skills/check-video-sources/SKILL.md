# Check Video Sources

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- User asks to check for new videos from the VS Code YouTube channel
- User wants to find demo timestamps for specific features
- User asks "what's new on the channel?" or "check the videos"
- User wants to add demo links to guide sections
- User mentions transcripts, video sources, or YouTube content
- User wants to verify a feature against a video demo

## Video Source

**Channel:** Visual Studio Code (@code)
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/@code
**RSS Feed:** https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCs5Y5_7XK8HLDX0SLNwkd3w

## Transcript Storage

**Location:** references/transcripts/code-channel/
**Index:** references/transcripts/code-channel/README.md

### File Naming Convention

{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}.md where the date is the publish date and slug is a short descriptive name.

Examples:
- 2026-02-19-agent-sessions-day.md
- 2026-02-13-let-it-cook-agent-steering.md
- 2026-02-13-kafka-mcp.md

### Transcript File Format

Every transcript file must include YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
video_id: tAezuMSJuFs
title: "VS Code Live: Agent Sessions Day"
url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAezuMSJuFs
channel: "@code (Visual Studio Code)"
published: 2026-02-19
speakers:
  - Speaker Name
topics:
  - topic-keyword
relevance: primary  # or secondary
---
```

Frontmatter fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| video_id | Yes | YouTube video ID |
| title | Yes | Full video title |
| url | Yes | Full YouTube watch URL |
| channel | Yes | Always "@code (Visual Studio Code)" |
| published | Yes | Publish date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| speakers | Yes | List of speaker names |
| topics | Yes | List of topic keywords for search |
| relevance | Yes | primary (directly covers guide topics) or secondary (tangentially related) |
| segment_videos | No | For livestreams: map of segment names to separate video IDs |

After frontmatter, include:
1. **Title heading**  # {Video Title}
2. **Summary**  One paragraph describing the video
3. **Agenda/Timestamps**  Table linking to specific moments (for long videos)
4. **Key Topics Covered**  Bullet list of main subjects
5. **Links**  URLs mentioned in the video
6. **Full Transcript**  The complete transcript text (user pastes this)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Check for New Videos

Fetch the YouTube RSS feed:

`
https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCs5Y5_7XK8HLDX0SLNwkd3w
`

Parse the feed entries. Each <entry> contains:
- <yt:videoId>  the video ID
- <title>  video title
- <published>  publish date
- <media:description>  video description (often contains the agenda)

Filter to videos published in the last 3 weeks.

### Step 2: Compare Against Existing Transcripts

Read references/transcripts/code-channel/README.md for the current index.

List files in references/transcripts/code-channel/ and check video_id in each file's frontmatter.

Identify new videos that don't have corresponding transcript files.

### Step 3: Assess Relevance

For each new video, check whether its title and description mention topics covered by the guide:

**Primary relevance keywords:** custom agents, instructions, copilot-instructions, file-based instructions, prompts, prompt files, skills, agent skills, MCP, model context protocol, hooks, coding agent, agent mode, sub-agents, handoffs, BYOM, bring your own model

**Secondary relevance keywords:** VS Code, Copilot, AI coding, agent, agentic, vibe coding, CLI

Skip videos that are purely about unrelated topics (e.g., themes, keybindings, non-AI extensions).

### Step 4: Create Transcript Files for New Videos

For each relevant new video:

1. Create a new file at references/transcripts/code-channel/{date}-{slug}.md
2. Populate YAML frontmatter from the RSS data
3. Add a summary section extracted from the video description
4. If the description contains timestamps/agenda, include them as a table
5. Add the ## Full Transcript section with a comment instructing the user to paste the transcript

### Step 5: Search Existing Transcripts

Use grep/search to find mentions of features, settings, or patterns in transcript files.

Cross-reference against the Topic Cross-Reference table in the README.

Identify timestamps where specific features are demoed  these can be linked from the guide.

### Step 6: Identify Demo Links for the Guide

Map transcript content to guide sections:

| Guide File | Potential Demo Links |
|------------|---------------------|
| docs/primitive-5-custom-agents.md | Videos about custom agents, agent skills, handoffs, sub-agents |
| docs/primitive-6-mcp.md | Videos about MCP servers, MCP apps, external integrations |
| docs/primitive-4-skills.md | Videos about agent skills, skill creation |
| docs/primitive-7-hooks.md | Videos about hooks, security enforcement |
| docs/part-1-foundations.md | Keynotes, overview talks, AI SDLC discussions |
| docs/primitive-1-always-on-instructions.md | Videos about copilot-instructions.md |
| docs/primitive-2-file-based-instructions.md | Videos about .instructions.md files |
| docs/primitive-3-prompts.md | Videos about prompt files |

Demo links in the guide use this format:

```markdown
**See it in action:** For a live demo, watch {Speaker Name} in [{Video Title}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={id}).
```

Do not include timestamps (`&t=` parameters) in the URL. Prefer standalone segment videos over timestamped livestream links when both exist.

Place the link after the section's opening paragraph or after the **Loading/Best For** metadata.

### Step 7: Update the README Index

After creating new transcript files, update references/transcripts/code-channel/README.md:

1. Add entries to the appropriate week's table in the Index section
2. Update the Topic Cross-Reference table if new videos cover guide topics
3. Keep weeks in reverse chronological order (newest first)

### Step 8: Present Findings

Report to the user with these sections:

- **New videos found:** List with titles, dates, and relevance assessment
- **Transcript coverage gaps:** Videos that exist but lack transcript text (user needs to paste)
- **Demo links to add:** Specific guide sections that should link to video demos, with timestamps
- **New information found:** Features, patterns, or announcements in transcripts not yet covered by the guide

Do not apply changes to guide docs automatically. Present findings and let the user decide.

## Edge Cases

- **YouTube RSS feed is unavailable:** Report the failure and search existing local transcripts only.
- **Video page requires login:** YouTube video pages redirect to login for automated fetch. Use the RSS feed for metadata and instruct the user to paste transcripts manually.
- **Livestream with multiple segments:** Create one master transcript file for the full stream. Reference individual segment videos in the segment_videos frontmatter field and in the agenda table.
- **Duplicate content:** If a segment is available both as part of a livestream and as a standalone clip, use the livestream as the primary file. Note the standalone clip URL in the agenda table.
- **Transcript not yet pasted:** Mark the file as having a coverage gap. The file is still useful for metadata, timestamps, and linking even without the full transcript.
