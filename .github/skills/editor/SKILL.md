## Issue Severity Levels

Report issues using these severity levels:

| Severity | Icon | Description | Action Required |
|----------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Critical** | 🔴 | Factually incorrect, broken functionality, security issue | Must fix before publish |
| **Major** | 🟠 | Confusing content, missing important information, broken links | Should fix |
| **Minor** | 🟡 | Style inconsistencies, typos, formatting issues | Nice to fix |
| **Suggestion** | 🔵 | Improvements that would enhance quality | Consider |

```

## Instructions

When reviewing a file:

1. **Read the full content** to understand context and purpose
2. **Check against the review checklist** systematically
3. **Verify external references** - fetch documentation if claims need validation
4. **Note line numbers** for each issue found
5. **Provide specific fixes** - not just "this is wrong" but "change X to Y"
6. **Prioritize issues** by severity
7. **Give a verdict** on whether the content is ready to publish

## Example Review

### Input
User modifies `docs/primitive-1-always-on-instructions.md`

### Output

```markdown
## Editorial Review: primitive-1-always-on-instructions.md

### Summary
Generally well-structured document covering always-on instructions. Found 1 critical issue (outdated setting name), 2 major issues (broken link, missing section), and 3 minor formatting inconsistencies.

### Critical Issues 🔴
- **Line 18:** Setting name may be outdated
  - **Problem:** `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles` - verify this setting still exists in current VS Code
  - **Fix:** Fetch VS Code documentation to confirm current setting name

### Major Issues 🟠
- **Line 45:** Internal link not working
  - **Problem:** Link to `#creating-files` section doesn't match any heading
  - **Fix:** Update to `#creating-an-instructions-file`

### Minor Issues 🟡
- Line 67: Inconsistent heading level (H4 should be H3)
- Line 123: Code block missing language identifier
- Line 201: Extra blank line

### Suggestions 🔵
- Consider adding a "Quick Start" section for users who want minimal setup
- The example at line 89 could benefit from comments

### Verdict
NEEDS REVISION - Fix critical and major issues before publishing
```

## Edge Cases

- **Empty files:** Report as critical issue, suggest content structure
- **Binary files:** Skip review, note that file is not reviewable
- **Very large files (>1000 lines):** Review in sections, note if file should be split
- **Non-English content:** Note language and skip style checks that don't apply
- **Generated files:** Check if file should be in .gitignore instead of reviewed

## Auto-Trigger Conditions

This skill should activate automatically when:
- Any `.md` file in `docs/` is modified
- `ReadMe.md` or `README.md` is modified
- Any file matching `*.instructions.md` is modified
- User explicitly requests a review

## Validation Sources

When verifying technical accuracy, check against:
- https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot (VS Code Copilot docs)
- https://docs.github.com/en/copilot (GitHub Copilot docs)
- Source code and configuration files in the repository
